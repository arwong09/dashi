Dashi (出汁, だし) is a family of stocks used in Japanese cuisine. Dashi forms the base for miso soup, clear broth soup, noodle broth soup, and many simmering liquids to accentuate the savory flavor known as umami.

This is a base configuration to quickly spin up a TypeScript + React + Tailwind + NextJS + Firebase app.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

## Configuring Firebase

To run the app you will need to create a Firebase account and rename `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local` and update the file with your app keys from Firebase

```
